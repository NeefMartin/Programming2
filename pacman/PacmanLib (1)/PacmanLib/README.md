# PacmanLib

## Usage

1. Download and extract to your favorite folder.
2. Browse through the code; make sure you globally understand how it works.
3. Add new header and source files to your needs depending on the challenge you are working on.
4. Compile and link all cpp files. Make sure the *include* directory is used and the SDL2 libraries can be found. After unzipping (before modifying any files) this boilerplate should compile and run without errors.
   * The manual contains hints on how to compile from command line while using the SDL2 library.

## SDL2 Dependency
